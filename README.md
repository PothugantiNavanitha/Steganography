## ✅ **How to use this**

- **Replace**:
  - `yourusername` with your GitHub username.
  - The *tech stack* info with your actual tools (Python, Java, OpenCV, Tkinter, etc.)
  - Add your real contact details & project links.
- If you have **example images**, put them in an `assets/` folder and update the image paths.
- Add `LICENSE` if you want (MIT recommended for open tools).
- If you have a GUI, briefly describe how to use it.

If you want, I can **generate a version with your exact language (Python/Java)** and a **custom usage example** too.  
Want it? Just say **“Yes, generate my language version!”** 🔒✨Perfect! Here’s a **professional, clean, and personalized `README.md`** for a **Steganography Project**, tailored **specifically for Pothuganti Navanitha** — with a tech-oriented tone, clear structure, and a personal touch.

You can **copy-paste** this directly to your project’s `README.md`.
Feel free to adjust your tech stack if you’re using Python, Java, or any other language.

# 🕵️‍♀️ Steganography Tool

Hi! I’m **Pothuganti Navanitha**, a passionate Computer Science student and tech enthusiast, and this is my **Steganography Tool** — a simple but powerful way to hide secret messages inside images securely.

---

## 🔍 What is Steganography?

**Steganography** is the art of concealing messages inside other non-secret text or data.  
This project demonstrates how to **encode and decode secret messages** within images using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** technique — making the hidden message invisible to the naked eye.

---

## ⚙️ Built With

- 💻 **Python** (or replace with your actual language)
- 📸 **OpenCV** or **PIL** for image processing
- 🖼️ **Tkinter** for optional GUI (if available)

---

## 📌 Features

✅ Encode secret messages inside images  
✅ Decode and reveal hidden messages from stego-images  
✅ Supports common image formats (PNG, BMP)  
✅ Clean and simple interface (CLI or GUI)  
✅ Educational example for learning Steganography concepts

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 📥 Clone this Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pothugantinavanitha/steganography-tool.git
cd steganography-tool
````

### ⚙️ Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ▶️ Run the Application

```bash
python steganography.py
```

Or, for the GUI version:

```bash
python gui.py
```

---

## ✨ Usage

### 🔐 Encode

1. Select a **cover image**.
2. Enter your **secret message**.
3. Run the encoder.
4. A new **stego-image** is generated — share it safely!

### 🔓 Decode

1. Load the **stego-image**.
2. Run the decoder.
3. The hidden message is extracted and displayed.

```

## 📚 How It Works

This tool uses **LSB (Least Significant Bit) Steganography**, which hides message bits in the least significant bits of the image pixels.
This makes changes undetectable to the human eye while safely embedding the data.
